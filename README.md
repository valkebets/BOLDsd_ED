## Data release

The main findings of our paper are available in the ```data_release``` folder. The data include the imaging and behavioral loadings associated with the first latent component (LC1), and the imaging and behavioral PLS scores of LC1 of all participants. The diagnostic group of participants is also listed in ```LC1_pls_scores.csv```.
