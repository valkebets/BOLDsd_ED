## Data release

The main findings of our paper are available in the ```data_release``` folder. The data include the imaging (i.e., BOLD variability) and clinical loadings associated with the first latent component (LC1), and the imaging and behavioral PLS scores of LC1 of all participants. The diagnostic group of participants is also listed in ```LC1_pls_scores.csv```.

## Code release

In the ```code``` folder, we provide code used in our paper.

* MRI preprocessing
* BOLD signal variability
* PLS analysis
* Control analyses
